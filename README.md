# Projects
This readme contains brief overviews into the scope and focus of each project.

## Project 1 - systems_models_analysis
#### **THIS IS AN UNFINISHED PROJECT**
This is not finalized, it is left a bit unfinished so ignore that if you will. 

#### ABOUT: Project 1
This is an Object-Oriented Program, and is made to model various types of multi-body astrological systems. Along with classes I created to facilitate the modeling this type of orbital motion, it includes integration methods as to model the motion itself. This one was special to me because it models the chaotic nature of these kinds of systems well and is the only project I have worked on outside of school for now.

## Project 2 - PHY415_project5
This is a completed and fully documented project I made for PHY 415 at Michigan State University.

#### ABOUT: Project 2
I started building my 1st project before this one. While project 1 is unpolished, I used the classes I made from that project to use here. In this class, we were exploring FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) manipulations. I thought it might be interesting to apply this to a sound wave made out of orbital patterns, essentially transforming the orbital motion of our solar system into something we can listen to. Alongside this, I made a few manipulations to cut out certain frequencies of sound, and also to hear specific parts of our system, as you will see as you go through the project. I hope you enjoy the end result of this, as it sounds quite funny.

## Project 3 - PHY491_FINAL_CNT
This is a completed research paper I wrote for PHY 491 at Michigan State University.

#### ABOUT: Project 3
This project showcases my ability to understand structures at a quantum level and is the first dip I have taken into materials science. For the coding section, nothing crazy was done, just modeling of energy bands for different chirality types of SWCNTs.

## Project 4 - PHY415_project2
This is another completed and fully documented project I made for PHY 415 at Michigan State University.

#### ABOUT: Project 4
This project explores the intricacies of the inverse-squared attractive force we see in so many aspects of physics. It looks at bound motion, the conditions under which it can be sustained, and unstable systems.

## Project 5 - PHY415_project4
This is another completed and fully documented project I made for PHY 415 at Michigan State University.

#### ABOUT: Project 5
This project is another where I use FFTs. I focus a bit on acoustics here and try my hand at adding distortion to a sound via adding even/odd harmonics through the FFT manually. This also could have been generalized in a function but I chose not to do that since that was not the focus of this project ad I was only working with one sound.

## PROSPECTIVE PROJECTS:
- IBM_ML_CERT: I am working on an IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate. Started August 2024.
